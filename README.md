# AVL Tree :deciduous_tree: 
## :pushpin: Short Description:
   This project implements the _AVL tree data structure_, namely the functions of adding a node, deleting, searching, and some others.
## :pushpin: AVL Tree:
   An AVL tree is a binary tree in which the **_heights of the left and right subtrees for each node differ by no more than one_**. This is the property of balance.
   
   It has been proven that this property provides a _logarithmic dependence_ of the tree height on the number of nodes, which increases the speed of basic operations        such as insertion, deletion and search.
